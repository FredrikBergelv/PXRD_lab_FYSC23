    Determining the structure of crystals is of the utmost importance for understanding the properties of a material, with applications in material science, electronics, and even medicine. This report uses the method of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) to analyze two unknown samples. Using the angle peaks from the detector and comparing these with tabulated values, the first sample was identified to be gold (Au), and the second one to be iron (Fe). Analysis using Scherrerâ€™s equation yielded the mean particle size for the gold powder to be approximately 13.44 nm and 11.2 nm for the iron powder. The results aligned with tabulated values, validating the method despite minor deviations attributed to instrumental uncertainties.
